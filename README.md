Create a new folder called "ros2_ws"

git clone this repository into ros2_ws

cd into the ros2_ws using VS_Code terminal

run "colcon build" in the terminal -- This should take up to 5 mins to build the relevant packages

Ensure the necessary program installations have been completed -- follow prompts to install relevant packages

Download and place the relevant texture files into the Mini3 Antarctica/textures folder and bungerhills/textures files found in the models folder in the uas_gazebo_sim

Please note this is now a purely local copy of both the uas_gazebo_sim repository and the px4_msgs repository and will not be able to be updated using source control.
