# Contributing to UAS Gazebo Simulator

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it is:

- Reporting a bug.
- Discussing the current state of the code.
- Submitting a fix.
- Proposing new features.
- Becoming a maintainer.

## Reporting Bugs, Feature Requests and Discussion Topics

Please check if the bug, feature request or discussion topic has already been created from the issue [list](https://gitlab.com/qut-asl-upo/uas_gazebo_sim/-/issues).

## Reporting Requirements

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background.
- Steps to reproduce.
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen.
- What actually happens.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that did not work).
- Logs (if possible).

## Submitting a Fix

Merge requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.
We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork or clone the repository and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you have added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you have changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that merge request!
